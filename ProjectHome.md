Manage your YouTube video watching, in an obsessive way. With keyboard controls. You've subscribed to 100+ channels, and you want to see their content, even when YouTube is having a bad day; even if you forgot to check it yesterday. Even if you're a month behind. Problem solved. Uses the official YouTube API to get video lists, creates playlists; then you go watch the playlist normally.

It's basically just what the YouTube homepage used to be before Google happened... plus with keyboard controls.
